## Research Focus

My research explores how multisensory integration shapes our perception of the environment. I investigate the cognitive processes that allow humans to combine information from different sensory modalities to form coherent perceptual experiences.

### Key Research Areas

#### Multisensory Integration
Investigating how the brain combines information from different sensory modalities (vision, audition, touch) to create unified perceptual experiences.

#### Perceptual Processing
Exploring the cognitive mechanisms underlying how we interpret and make sense of sensory information from our environment.

#### Cognitive Neuroscience
Using neuroimaging techniques to understand the neural correlates of multisensory perception and integration.

## Methodologies

My research employs various methodologies to investigate cognitive processes:

- **Behavioral Testing**: Psychophysical experiments to measure perceptual thresholds and response patterns
- **Neuroimaging**: Using techniques such as fMRI to examine brain activity during multisensory tasks
- **Eye Tracking**: Monitoring gaze patterns to understand visual attention and information processing
- **Computational Modeling**: Developing models to predict perceptual outcomes in multisensory scenarios
