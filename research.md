## Research Focus

My research focuses on understanding how people interact with products, systems, and environments. I investigate user behavior, preferences, and needs to inform effective design and development.

### Key Research Areas

#### User Experience & Usability
Evaluating how people interact with interfaces and products to identify pain points and opportunities for improvement.

#### Human Factors
Analyzing how cognitive and physical capabilities influence user interactions to optimize design for human use.

#### Applied Research
Translating research insights into practical recommendations that drive product development and innovation.

#### Regulatory Compliance
Developing human factors deliverables that meet FDA requirements and usability engineering standards for medical devices and combination products.

## Research Methods

I employ a comprehensive set of research methodologies:

- **Moderated Research**: In-person and remote user testing, interviews, and contextual inquiry
- **Unmoderated Research**: Remote testing platforms, surveys, and automated data collection
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Observing and measuring user interactions and task performance
- **Eye Tracking**: Tracking visual attention patterns to understand user focus and information processing
- **Usability Evaluation**: Identifying design issues through expert reviews and user testing
